I'm a cross-functional Software Engineer, passionate about cloud architectures and distributed systems.

I love learning new things, playing around with the latest tech, and figuring out how things work. There’s something about the process of solving problems that excites me. Currently I'm getting involved with microservices with Golang in Docker, and in general I keep learning about technologies.

I strongly believe in Kaizen as philosophy of work and life, because for me there is always something to improve and hence learn from it.

For more information about my experience please refer to my [resume](/resume).

##### More about me
When I’m not programming, I’m often discovering new music, trying to better understand the world reading on [Quora](https://quora.com), enjoying the nature and chilling with family, friends and my little puppy Maya.
